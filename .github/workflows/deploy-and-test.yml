name: Deploy & Test Pipeline

# This workflow handles deployment and ALL E2E testing on real environments.
# ci.yml runs FAST checks only: typecheck, lint, unit tests, rules tests
# This workflow runs: deploy → comprehensive testing → deploy to prod
#
# Flow:
# 1. CI workflow runs fast quality checks (2-3 min)
# 2. This workflow deploys to Vercel staging (1-2 min)
# 3. Runs comprehensive tests on staging (8-12 min):
#    - E2E Desktop tests
#    - E2E Mobile tests (RTL, critical paths)
#    - Performance tests
# 4. If all tests pass, deploys to production
# 5. Runs smoke tests on production
