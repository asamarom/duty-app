name: Deploy & Test Pipeline

# This workflow complements ci.yml by testing on REAL deployed environments.
# ci.yml runs: typecheck, lint, unit tests, rules tests, E2E with emulators
# This workflow runs: deploy to staging → E2E on real staging → deploy to prod
#
# Flow:
# 1. CI workflow runs all tests with emulators
# 2. This workflow deploys to Vercel staging and tests the real deployment
# 3. If staging tests pass, deploys to production
# 4. Runs smoke tests on production
