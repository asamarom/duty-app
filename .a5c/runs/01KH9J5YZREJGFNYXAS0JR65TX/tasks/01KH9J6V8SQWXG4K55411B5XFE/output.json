    "I18N-3 (Custom Translation Engine) is marked as not-testable because it is an internal implementation detail. Consider adding unit tests for translation key lookups if not already covered.",
    "ONBOARD-1 (Google Auth signup) is marked as not-testable in E2E due to OAuth limitations. This is acceptable given the test mode bypass exists for E2E testing.",
    "Overall test coverage is excellent at 94.64% with 53 out of 56 requirements covered by E2E tests.",
    "The 2 gaps are both marked as 'not-testable' with valid reasons, indicating no actionable coverage gaps.",
    "All critical workflows (transfers, approvals, auth, equipment, personnel) have full E2E coverage.",
    "Consider periodic review of 'not-testable' items to determine if testing approach has changed."
