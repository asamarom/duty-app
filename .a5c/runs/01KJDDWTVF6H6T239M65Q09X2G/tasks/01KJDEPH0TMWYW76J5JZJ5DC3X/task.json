    "fixDescription": "Fixed RTL test failures by updating selectors to match actual application structure. The tests were waiting for 'header, [role=\"banner\"]' which doesn't exist in the application. Updated to wait for actual page content (h1 title element) that reliably loads on the page. This fixes the root cause of 12 failing RTL tests across desktop and mobile viewports. Personnel seeding was verified and confirmed to be working correctly - no changes needed."
